- Progress bars and loading indicators
- Clear visual distinction between upload modes
- Professional modal design

## 🐛 Critical Fix Applied

### Issue: Album Upload File Dialog Not Working
**Problem**: In album upload mode, clicking the "Upload Album" button or upload area did not trigger the file dialog or show the modal after file selection. Only drag-and-drop worked.

**Root Cause**: React state batching was causing the modal to render before `pendingFiles` state was updated, resulting in an empty file list.

**Solution**: Used React's `flushSync` to ensure state updates happen synchronously:

```tsx
// Before (problematic)
setPendingFiles(files);
setShowAlbumModal(true); // Modal renders with empty pendingFiles

// After (fixed)
setPendingFiles(files);
flushSync(() => {
  setShowAlbumModal(true); // Modal renders after pendingFiles is updated
});
```

This ensures the modal appears with the correct file list populated from the file input dialog.

## 🎯 Technical Implementation

### State Management
- `uploadMode`: Controls single vs album mode
- `pendingFiles`: Files waiting to be processed in album mode
- `showAlbumModal`: Controls album modal visibility
- `selectedFiles`: Currently uploaded files with metadata
- `uploadProgress`: Real-time upload progress tracking

### File Handling
- Unified file processing for drag-drop and file input
- FileList to Array conversion for easier manipulation
- File validation and preview generation
- Metadata attachment to each file

### Modal System
- Album upload modal with form validation
- Media preview modal for individual files
- Proper event handling and state cleanup

## 🚀 Usage Instructions
