  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <h1>My Astronomy Tours</h1>
      <MediaUploadPanel 
        onMediaUploaded={(media) => {
          // Save to backend
          saveTourMedia(media);

  );
};
```

    mediaFiles.forEach((media, index) => {
      formData.append(`file-${index}`, media.file);
      formData.append(`metadata-${index}`, JSON.stringify({
        description: media.description,
        tourName: media.tourName,
        location: media.location,
        tags: media.tags
      }));
    });

    await fetch('/api/upload-tour-media', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData,
    });
    
    // Show success notification
    showNotification('Media uploaded successfully!');
