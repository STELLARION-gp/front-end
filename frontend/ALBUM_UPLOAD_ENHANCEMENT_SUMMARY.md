# Album Upload Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the Media Upload Panel to support album (bulk) upload functionality, allowing astronomy guides to upload multiple images at once with shared details, in addition to the existing single upload mode.

## New Features

### 1. Upload Mode Toggle
- Added toggle tabs in the header: "Single Upload" and "Album Upload"
- Dynamic UI that adapts based on the selected mode
- Visual indicators showing current mode

### 2. Album Upload Functionality
- **Smart Detection**: When multiple files are selected (either via file dialog or drag-and-drop), the system automatically prompts for album upload
- **Album Modal**: User-friendly modal for entering shared album details:
  - Album Name
  - Album Description  
  - Tour Name
  - Location
  - Tags (comma-separated)
- **Bulk Processing**: All selected files receive the shared album details
- **File Preview**: Shows list of files to be uploaded with file sizes

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Drag & Drop**: Improved drag-and-drop area with mode-specific messaging
- **Smart Defaults**: Single file uploads automatically use single mode
- **Visual Feedback**: Upload area text changes based on current mode
- **Progress Tracking**: Individual progress bars for each file during upload
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout for all new components

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- **Mode-Specific Upload Area**: Different messaging for single vs album mode
- **Styled Toggle Tabs**: Clean, professional toggle buttons
- **Enhanced File List**: Better file preview in album modal
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches existing theme and design system
- **Accessibility**: Proper labels and keyboard navigation

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
- Updated `MediaUploadPanel.tsx` with new state management for album uploads
- Added `AlbumData` interface for shared album information
- Enhanced file handling logic to support both upload modes

### State Management
- `uploadMode`: Controls current upload mode (single/album)
- `albumData`: Stores shared album information
- `showAlbumModal`: Controls album modal visibility  
- `pendingFiles`: Holds files waiting for album processing

### Styling
- Added comprehensive SCSS styles for upload mode tabs
- Styled album modal with consistent theme
- Enhanced upload area with mode-specific styling
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## File Changes
- `MediaUploadPanel.tsx`: Enhanced with album upload functionality
- `_mediaUploadPanel.scss`: Added styles for new UI components
- `Dashboard.tsx`: Updated to use MediaUploadPanel directly (removed redundant MediaGalleryPage)
- `main.scss`: Cleaned up imports after removing redundant files
- `ALBUM_UPLOAD_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md`: This documentation

## Cleanup Performed
- **Removed Redundancy**: Deleted `MediaGalleryPage.tsx` and `_mediaGalleryPage.scss` as they were redundant wrappers
- **Simplified Architecture**: Dashboard now uses `MediaUploadPanel` directly with `showSidebar={false}`
- **Cleaner Imports**: Removed unnecessary imports from main.scss

## How to Use

### Single Upload Mode (Default)
1. Select "Single Upload" tab
2. Drop or select individual files
